MVL
======

Chess comunity shorts the name of [Maxime Vachier-Lagrave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxime_Vachier-Lagrave) as MVL (see a [random example]()). But I realized that MVL in fact is [Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lomonosov). Moscow University named after him.
